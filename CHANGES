The delevelopment of GNULibMode has started. I think I'll separate this module
in the future, but the main concept will remain unchanged. Just to let you know
that development still continues.

Paul Eggert was added to the list of authors (see __author__ variable). Method
date from GNULibInfo was commented to help developers understand how the date
is calculated. Module is now separated for better maintainability. Instead of
single gnulib-tool.py you get pygnulib package and two modules: constants.py
and utilities.py.
constants module now contains all date which user or developers can change (e.g.
paths for automake, autoconf utilities, authors, application name, etc.). To 
understand how to use constants look inside the utilities.py module (see 'Define
module information' and 'Define global constants' sections). All the future
parts of pygnulib module will use the same model to define constants.
utilities module now contains GNULibInfo class. I think the most part of classes
will be placed here; however some modules can be separated in the future.

Just a small fix with strings to obtain backward-compatibility with Python 2
from Python 3. Now you can either run (python2 gnulib-tool.py) or (python3
gnulib-tool.py). I remind that you must copy gnulib-tool.py file to directory
with the original gnulib-tool.

New variable was added, called FILES. It is a dictionary like DIRS variable,
but it will store some paths to neccessary files. The first such file is
ChangeLog file, which is used in (git log ChangeLog) command. Two new methods
were added to GNULibInfo class: date and version (the last one is now available
only for git, I will add support for CVS later). Note that name method inside
GNULibInfo class was renamed to package, because it's more correct. If you type
(python gnulib.py), you will receive the same output as from (gnulib-tool
--version) command (however the first line will say that name of application is
gnulib-tool.py until you rename it). However to test this feature you have to
place new gnulib-tool in folder where the old one is placed.
I've also added two new files to root: architecture.odg and functions.odt just
to have their copies. However it may be useful to have these files online.

APPS variable is now called UTILS. Some variables like __appname__, __appath__
and __appdir__ were replaced to global APP dictionary, which now contains args
'name' and 'path'. New global variable DIRS was created to store full paths of
the main directory and subdirectories. New GNULibInfo class was created; it
contains some useful methods like name, authors, license and copyright. Don't be
confused with some similar variables like __author__, __license__, etc. The new
methods and variables are similar, but they are not the same: methods will
provide user information which will be mostly used in stdout messages. Later I
am going to add version method, which will extract versions of script and from
git (or CVS if we will use it in the future). You can see almost completed
stdout message which you can get from (gnulib-tool.sh --version). To see it
just run (python gnulib-tool.py).

Some global variables were added. Variables that contain paths of neccessary
applications (AUTOCONF, AUTORECONF, AUTOHEADER, AUTOMAKE, ACLOCAL, AUTOPOINT,
LIBTOOLIZE, MAKE) were combined into one dict object (APPS), so in the furure I
have to use e.g. APP['autoconf'] instead of AUTOCONF. I know that this style is
longer, but I think it is a good idea to combinate similar variables into
dictionaries and lists. While it seems that some variables (AUTOCONFPATH,
AUTOMAKEPATH, GETTEXTPATH and LIBTOOLPATH) won't be used later, I've decided to
delete them using del() statement to free memory and just to be consistent.
